# GMET
Gridded Meteorological Ensemble Tool

Notes:
* This code is a work in progress and is provided without guarantee of fitness for any particular application.   
* The SHARP branch is used operationally to generate real-time ensemble model forcings at NCAR.  It is likely to be the most up-to-date and complete.  The only direct pushes to the SHARP branch, however, are made from the operational clone after testing in the operational context.
